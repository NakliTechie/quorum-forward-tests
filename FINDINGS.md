# What we have found out about our own engine (published 19 Aug 2026, before Forward Test 2 scores)

*Moved from the [README](README.md) on 2026-11-09.*

We run diagnostics on our own method and publish what they find, including when the
finding weakens a result we have already reported. This one does.

**The engine's absolute level is a fixed prior. It does not respond to the era.** We put
twelve mechanically-built, date-only context anchors to the frozen engine, spanning
February 2017 to August 2026 — a period over which real presidential approval moved
between 34% and 49%. The engine returned **29.7% to 33.2%** for every one of them. The
slope of our prediction against the published truth is **+0.004** (r = +0.023): about
four hundredths of a point of movement for every point reality moved. It never exceeded
33.2%, even against anchors whose true value was 49%. The flatness holds equally for
dates inside the model's training data and dates after it, so this is not a memory
limitation — it is a fixed prior.

**What that means for Forward Test 1, which passed.** Its topline pass was substantially
a coincidence: the published figure was 35.0%, our engine's constant sits near 32%, and
the context facts plus the calibration lifted it to 34.9%. Had the identical registered
method been aimed at the December 2025 wave, it would have predicted roughly 35% against
a published 41% — a six-point miss and a failed bar. **We do not forecast movement, and
no absolute level from this engine should be trusted without an external anchor.**

**What is not affected.** The party-structure result stands: raw party error of 21.4
points versus 7.23 for the calibrated engine is a *difference between two engines on
identical inputs*, which no shared level prior can manufacture. Per-respondent
discrimination (AUC 0.896 against real individual answers) is likewise independent of
level.

**What we are doing about it.** The registered series continues unchanged — the frozen
method is the record, and altering it after seeing a result would defeat the purpose.
Alongside it we are building a two-stage engine of the kind survey statisticians already
use for this exact problem: the model supplies the conditional structure it is genuinely
good at, and a small amount of real data supplies the level. Future registrations will
also carry a **movement bar** — predicting the change from the previous published wave,
which a fixed prior cannot fake.

Evidence: twelve-anchor sweep, 19 August 2026. We publish this before Forward Test 2 is
scored rather than after, so it cannot be mistaken for an explanation of a result we have
already seen.
